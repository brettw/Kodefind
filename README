Kodefind is a simple GUI tool for Windows to find and open C and C++ files.

Its job is to quickly index the file names in a large repo, like say chrome. It can search-as-you-type over 40k files.

To use:
1- Run the exe (kodefind.exe), a dialog should show up
2- Click on the 'dir' button, select a directory that has your code
3- It will quickly index the directory and all subdirectories for .c, .cc, .cpp, .h files
4- When done the other controls activate
5- Type at least 3 letters on the top edit box, you should see results below
6- Double click any file to open it on the default editor
7- It installs a system-wide hotkey, currently win+z so it can be quickly invoked.

Notes:
- The src\kodefind.rc is a utf-16 encoded text file, so git diff does not work. You can see it in any browser by using the 'raw' option.
- Only VS2010 is provided. Manual conversion to VS2008 should be trivial.
- Only x64 target is specified in the solution. Adding a 32-bit target should be easy.

Todo:
- Add version information to the binary
- Recognize more common C++ extensions
- Add some form of help
- Add some form of configuration
